Repository for CO2 emissions analysis

This is a project held in the context of a Linear Statistics MSc Course. The objective was to apply various data analytics techniques and develop a model that could explain potential causes of CO2 emissions. 

The dataset was provided by the professor of the course, which he got from https://ourworldindata.org/

Finally, we developed a model that could explain 85% of the variability of CO2 emissions with independent 4 variables that were shown to be statistically significant; population, happiness_index, fertility_rate and income_level. 

This project was developed with my colleagues Shurui Chen and Emmanuel Okon.
